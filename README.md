Training and Testing a machine learning model

Classifying a "cats vs dogs" dataset using neural networks involves training a machine learning model 
to accurately distinguish between images of cats and images of dogs.
This is a common example of a binary image classification problem.

The dataset used for this task was taken from kaggle
'kaggle datasets download -d salader/dogs-vs-cats'
To train this neural network for this task,labeled dataset of 25000 cat and dog images is used. 
Each image is typically represented as a matrix of pixel values, which serves as the input to the neural network.

## This model can classify a cat or a dog with >78% accuracy
