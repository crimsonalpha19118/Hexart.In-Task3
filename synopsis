Classification using neural networks is a machine learning problem that involves using artificial neural networks 
to assign a class label to an input sample based on a set of features. This approach is commonly used in a variety of applications,
including image classification, text classification, and speech recognition, among others.

The problem statement in classification using neural networks is to train a model that can accurately predict the class label of a given input sample.
This is typically accomplished by training the model on a large labeled dataset, where each sample is associated with a set of features 
and a corresponding class label. The goal is to learn a mapping from the features to the class label such that the model can make accurate predictions 
on unseen data.

Classification using neural networks is a powerful approach because it can handle complex and non-linear relationships between the features and the class label.
Additionally, neural networks can learn hierarchical representations of the data, allowing them to capture high-level patterns in the data that are not easily 
represented by simple linear models.

However, this approach also comes with certain challenges, including the potential for overfitting to the training data,
the need for large amounts of labeled data, and the difficulty in interpreting the learned representations. Nevertheless, 
with careful tuning and regularization, neural networks can be highly effective in solving complex classification problems.

Classifying a "cats vs dogs" dataset using neural networks involves training a machine learning model to accurately distinguish between images of cats and 
images of dogs. This is a common example of a binary image classification problem, and neural networks are a powerful approach to solving this type of problem.
